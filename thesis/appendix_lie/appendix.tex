The appendix aims to present some basic concepts of the \emph{Lie groups} theory.  The Lie group is a mathematical abstract entity that dates back to the nineteenth century when mathematician Sophus Lie established the idea of continuous transformation groups. Many years later, its effect has expanded over a wide range of scientific and technological fields. Lie groups, on the other hand, are very abstract creations for the great majority of roboticists, making them difficult to grasp and employ. This chapter will take an \emph{utilitaristic} approach to describe such frameworks, emphasizing intuitive comprehension of their meaning and functions above the breadth and depth of arguments and proofs. Once the Lie groups' formalism has been introduced, we present two examples of Lie groups often exploited in robotics, namely, the group of the rotation matrices and the group of the roto-translation matrices.

The reader who wants a more thorough and rigorous understanding of the Lie groups theory should consult the extensive literature, where it is worth mentioning \citep{Sola2018ARobotics} from which part of this appendix took inspiration. Other complete and more rigorous dissertations are \citep{Warner1971,Hall2015,Kirillov2008AnAlgebras,Howe1983VeryTheory}.
