\chapter{Benchmarking of Simplified-Model Controllers for Locomotion\label{chapter:simplified_benchmarking}}

In Part~\ref{part:wbc}, we discussed whole-body controllers that take into account different types of robots, as well as the interaction between the robot and the environment. Independently of the choice of the whole-body controller, we assumed a high-level algorithm that provides the reference for the Cartesian trajectories, e.g., CoM and foot trajectories. This part presents the design of two high-level controllers that compute the commands for the whole-body control layer presented in Part~\ref{part:wbc}. This chapter, in particular, defines the three-layer controller architecture illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:three-layer} as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:three-layer-simplified-benchmarking}.
The \emph{whole-body QP control} ensures the tracking of the desired CoM and foot trajectories by considering the complete robot models. A detailed design of different kinds of whole-body controllers is discussed in Part~\ref{part:wbc}.
The \emph{trajectory optimization} layer is maintained fixed with a unicycle-based planner~\citep{8594277} that generates the desired DCM and foot trajectories.Â 
The \emph{simplified model controller} is responsible for implementing a control law that stabilizes the unstable DCM dynamics. We approach the stabilization problem by designing two different controllers: an \emph{instantaneous} and a \emph{predictive} one.
We compare several combinations of the control architecture with the kinematics-based whole-body QP control layer presented in Section~\ref{sec:ik_qp}.
We carried out the test on the humanoid robot iCub v2.7 -- see Section~\ref{sec:icub2.7}.

The chapter is organized as follows. Section~\ref{sec:background-bachmarking} introduces a state-of-the-art implementation of the footstep planner and the DCM planner implemented in the~\emph{trajectory optimization layer}. Section~\ref{sec:simplified_model_architecture} details the components constituting the simplified model blocks of the three-layer controller architecture. Section~\ref{sec:results_simplified_benchmarking} presents the experimental validation of the proposed approaches and shows an explanatory table comparing the different simplified control strategies. Finally, Section~\ref{sec:conclusion_simplified_benchmarking} concludes the chapter.
