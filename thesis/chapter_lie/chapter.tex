In this chapter, we introduce the rotation group $\SO(3)$ and the rototranslation (Euclidean) group $\SE(3)$. For each group. These two entities play a crucial role in modeling the dynamics of a rigid body system. For each group, we present the definition and analyze its properties.
The chapter also presents the dynamics of a rigid body system subject to an external force.
The chapter is organized as follows. Section~\ref{sec:so3} introduces the rotation group, Section~\ref{sec:se3} presents the rototranslation group $\SE(3)$ and the dynamics of the rigid body system. Finally, in Section~\ref{sec:lie-crash}, we guide the reader through the similarity between the rotation and the Euclidean groups. We then introduce the \emph{Lie Group} as a generalization of the rotation and roto-translation sets. 
A more rigorous introduction of \emph{Lie Group} theory is discussed in Appendix~\ref{appendix:lie}.
