\section{The rotation and euclidean groups: a Lie groups prospective~\label{sec:lie-crash}}

In Sections~\ref{sec:so3} and~\ref{sec:se3} we present the rotation and Euclidian groups. One may have noticed some similarities between the two sets. Indeed, we have
\begin{itemize}
    \item Both sets are groups under the matrix product operator.
    \item Both groups admit a left and a right velocity
    \item Both groups admit an Exponential and a Logarithm map.
\end{itemize}
\par
This similarity is not accidental. Indeed $\SO(3)$ and $\SE(3)$ are two examples of \emph{Matrix Lie Group}.
In this context we say that the angular velocity $\omega$ and the spatial 6D velocity $\mathrm{v}$ belong to the \emph{Lie Algebra} of $\SO(3)$ and $\SE(3)$, denoted respectively by $\so(3)$ and $\se(3)$.
In Appendix~\ref{appendix:lie}, we generalize the concepts presented in this chapter to a generic Matrix Lie Group.
